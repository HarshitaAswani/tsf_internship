# tsf_internship
This internship was all about data science and business analytics.
I applied for this internship from the website of The Sparks Foundation.
There were total 8 data science and business analytics tasks. Out of 8, data science and business analytics interns needed to complete at least 1. I completed 6 tasks.

## Task-1: LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL

### LEVEL: BEGINNER

I predicted the score of a student based on the study hours. I used linear regression model for predicting the score. The data provided was having two columns: score and hours. I trained the 80% data and tested the rest 20%.

## Task-2: UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

### LEVEL: BEGINNER

I predicted the optimum number of clusters by using k-means clustering which comes under the category of unsupervised machine learning. The dataset was having information about the IRIS flower: sepal length, petal length, sepal width, petal width and species. Using elbow method, I predicted the optimum number of clusters was 3.

## Task-3: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS - RETAIL

### LEVEL: BEGINNER

I created a dashboard using tableau that consists of various charts and graphs. The charts and graphs show the relationship between various attributes. By looking at the charts and graphs, one can gain insights and predict where the retail store is lacking and needs improvement.

## Task-4: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS - TERRORISM

### LEVEL: INTERMEDIATE

I created a dashboard using tableau that consists of various charts and graphs. The charts and graphs show the relationship between various attributes. By looking at the charts and graphs, one can gain insights and predict where the terrorism is more or which region comes under the hot zone.

## Task-5: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS - SPORTS

### LEVEL: ADVANCED

I created a dashboard using tableau that consists of various charts and graphs. The charts and graphs show the relationship between various attributes. By looking at the charts and graphs, one can gain insights and predict which player or team is the best.

## Task-6: DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER

### LEVEL: INTERMEDIATE

I created a decision tree classifier for the IRIS flower dataset. The classifier predicts the species according the specific attributes of the flower such as sepal length, petal length, sepal width or petal width.
